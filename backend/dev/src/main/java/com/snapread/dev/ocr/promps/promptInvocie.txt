invoiceNumber: The document number is a unique identifier assigned to an invoice or other official document. It is essential for tracking and referencing in both seller and buyer records. Typically labeled as "Numer Faktury," "Invoice Number," or simply "No.," it is usually found in the upper part of the document, near the document type or title.

supplierName: The supplier's name identifies the business or individual providing the goods or services. Common labels include 'Supplier Name,' 'Nazwa Dostawcy,' or 'Vendor.' It is typically found near the top of the document alongside other supplier details.

supplierNip: The supplier's tax identification number (NIP) is a unique identifier used for tax purposes. Common labels include 'NIP,' 'Tax ID,' or 'VAT Number,' and it is usually located near the supplier's name and address. In case of dashes or blank spaces remove them.

supplierAddress: The supplier's address specifies the location of the business or individual issuing the invoice. Common labels include 'Supplier Address,' 'Adres Dostawcy,' or 'Vendor Address,' and it is generally found near the supplier's name and other contact details.

amountNet: The net amount represents the total value of goods or services before VAT or other taxes are applied. It serves as the base value for tax calculation and financial summaries. Common labels include "Net," "Netto," or "Net Amount," and it is usually found in the itemized table or the summary section of the document. This value should be represented as a double (floating-point number) to accurately reflect potential decimal values.

amountVat: The VAT amount is the tax applied to the net value of goods or services. It is a mandatory component of tax invoices and is often indicated as "VAT," "Podatek VAT," or "Tax." This value is typically presented in the financial summary near the net and gross amounts. This value should be represented as a double (floating-point number) to ensure precision in tax calculations.

amountGross: The gross amount is the total payable value, including the net amount and VAT. It represents the final amount the buyer must pay. Commonly labeled as "Brutto," "Gross," or "Total Amount," it is found in the document's financial summary or conclusion. This value should be represented as a double (floating-point number) to capture exact financial figures with decimal precision.

vatPercent: "The VAT rate indicates the percentage of VAT applied to the transaction. It is necessary for calculating the VAT amount and understanding the applicable tax rules. The VAT rate can vary for different items on the invoice, so it is important to account for all rates used. This field returns a list of VAT rates, even if only one rate is applied. Common labels include '%VAT', 'VAT Rate', 'Stawka VAT', and it is typically located near the net and VAT values, often in an itemized table."

invoiceDate: The issue date is the official date when the document was created and issued. It is crucial for accounting periods and compliance checks. Commonly labeled as "Data Wystawienia," "Issued On," or "Date of Issue," it is typically located near the top of the document, close to the document number or issuer's details.

dueDate: The payment deadline specifies the latest date by which the invoice should be settled. It is critical for managing cash flow and enforcing contractual obligations. Labeled as "Termin Płatności," "Due Date," or "Payment Deadline," it is commonly located in the payment details section.

description: The invoice description provides a concise summary of the goods or services covered by the invoice. It is essential for understanding the transaction context.
